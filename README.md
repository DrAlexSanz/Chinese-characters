Chinese-characters (fonts)
This is just a way to upload the dataset and free up some space.

I obtained the dataset from: https://blog.usejournal.com/making-of-a-chinese-characters-dataset-92d4065cc7cc

Amazing work, I can use it to train something that in the end will recognize handwritten characters. This is "only" fonts. I can use the pretrained model for the handwritten characters as a second step.
